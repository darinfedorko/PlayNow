/*This is the main method of our Deliverable 2 for PlayNOW! All MVC classes have been renamed so they are clear to see. 
TO TEST THIS PROGRAM, please first click 'scrape for songs', then 'create playlist'. The table view will show a randomized playlist
object in row and column form. If the program crashes, please make sure that the JSOUP library/jar is included in the libraries. (It will be incuded in our submission.
Also, Scraper will be included in the Model in the future. (We are currently figuring out how this should be done.) 
A round trip of data can be seen anywhere where a button is pressed. The view listens for the button press and calls a controller method that
asks the model for information and outputs it to the display.
